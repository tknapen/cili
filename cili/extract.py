    """ Extracts ranges from samples based on event timing.

    This method works, but has been replaced by extract_events (below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples (Samples object)
        The Samples object from which you'd like to extract ranges.
    events_dataframe (DataFrame object containing event timing info)
        Indices should be onset times, duration should be in a column named
        'duration'. Note that if you have an Events object evs, and it has,
        say, a set of events named "EBLINK", then you can pass evs.EBLINK
        for this argument.
    start_offset (number - same type as your samples index, probably ms)
        Each index of the events_dataframe is an event onset time, and we add
        the start_offset to each of these times to find the beginnings of our
        target ranges, then search the sample times to find the sample indices
        of these range onset times. If there isn't an exact match, we pick the
        last sample time before the range onset time.
    end_offset (number - same type as your samples index, probably ms)
        Like start_offset, but for the offsets of target ranges instead of the
        onsets. Note, the sample containing the range offset time will be
        *included* in the extracted range.
    borrow_attributes (list of strings)
        A list of column names in the events_dataframe whose values you would
        like to copy to the respective ranges. For each item in the list, a
        column will be created in the ranges dataframe - if the column does
        not exist in the events dataframe, the values in the each
        corrisponding range will be set to float('nan').
    round_indices (bool)
        Deprecated.

    """ Extracts ranges from samples based on event timing and sample count.

    Note that we will exclude any ranges which would cross discontinuities in
    the dataset. If there are no events to return, we will return None

    Parameters
    ==========
    samples (Samples object)
        The Samples object from which you'd like to extract ranges.
    events (DataFrame object containing event timing info)
        Indices should be onset times, duration should be in a column named
        'duration'. Note that if you have an Events object evs, and it has,
        say, a set of events named "EBLINK", then you can pass evs.EBLINK
        for this argument.
    offset (number)
        How to position extraction range start relative to event start.
        Interpretation depends upon 'units'. Default 0.
    duration (number)
        How long a range to extract. Interpretation depends upon 'units'.
        Default 0. Note that if this and offset are both 0, you'll get None in
        return.
    units (string constant)
        Can be 'time' or 'samples'. Default is 'samples'. Determines which index
        will be used to interpret the offset and duration parameters. If units
        is 'time', then we will extract ranges offset from each event's start
        time by 'offset' ms, and 'duration' ms long (or as close as we can get
        given your sampling frequency). Actually, we use the sample count of
        the first event as a template for all events, so this method can be a
        little slippery. For finer control over the size of the returned
        dataset, you can set 'units' to 'samples'. Then, we will extract ranges
        offset from each event's start time by 'offset' *samples*, and
        'duration' samples long. It's then up to you to calculate how long the
        sample is in time, based on your sampling rate.
    borrow_attributes (list of strings)
        A list of column names in the 'events' whose values you would like to
        copy to the respective ranges. For each item in the list, a column
        will be created in the ranges dataframe - if the column does not exist
        in the events dataframe, the values in the each corrisponding range
        will be set to float('nan').
    return_count (bool)
        If true, will return the number of events extracted
